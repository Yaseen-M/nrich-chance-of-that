# NRICH Chance of That

## Description

This project is an investigation into the NRICH problem [Chance of That](https://nrich.maths.org/7287). NRICH set the problem as follows:

_I was looking at two seemingly random lists of 12 whole numbers chosen from 1 to 5. The sample correlation was exactly zero._

_Convince yourself that such a list of numbers is possible. Can you get a feel for the properties of such lists?_

_Explore the properties and frequencies of such lists of numbers, perhaps varying the two numbers involved._
