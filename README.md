# NRICH Chance of That

## Description

This project is an investigation into the NRICH problem [Chance of That](https://nrich.maths.org/7287). NRICH sets the problem as follows:

> I was looking at two seemingly random lists of 12 whole numbers chosen from 1 to 5. The sample correlation was exactly zero.

> Convince yourself that such a list of numbers is possible. Can you get a feel for the properties of such lists?

> Explore the properties and frequencies of such lists of numbers, perhaps varying the two numbers involved.

## Installation

The `requirements.txt` file lists all of the required Python libraries. They can be installed using:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

## Credits

- Thanks to NRICH for providing the problem and accepting my solution.
